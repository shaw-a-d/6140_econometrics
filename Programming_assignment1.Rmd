#data creation
#This step creates a random variable with half of the observations centered at 2 with standard deviation 1 and half centered at 6 with standard deviation 1/2.

#step 1
x <- c(rtruncnorm(500, a=-Inf, b=Inf, mean=2, sd=1),  rtruncnorm(500, a=-Inf, b=Inf, mean=6, sd=0.5)) 

#step 2
e <- rnorm(nn,0,3)
#step 3
y <- 2*x+e

#step 4-Summary
mean(x)
sd(x)
hist(x,breaks=18, freq=FALSE,xlim=c(-1,8))


#Problem 1-What happens to the probability density function as the standard deviation of either of the peaks changes in the step 1? What happens to the SD. of X as the means change? Play around with the means and standard deviations to see.


#Problem 2-Pictured is a bimodal distribution, make a trimodal distribution. A trimodal distribution has three peaks.

#Problem 3- Compute the correlation of x and y. What happens to the correlation of x and y as the SD of X increases? 



#Monte Carlo's

#step 1- Set the number of observations per peak
nn <- 3

#step 2-Set the number of simulations
runs<-3

#step 3-program a function that creates random variables and returns the mean

e <- rnorm(nn,0,3)
y <- 2*x+e
mean.x<-mean(x)
return(mean.x)

#Problem 4-What parameters effect how fast the sampling distribution becomes normal? (Hint: play with the parameters until your histogram looks normal)
